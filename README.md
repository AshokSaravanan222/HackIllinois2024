## Inspiration
We thought about the days when we just weren't quite sure what to wear, and we didn't want to just throw on whatever because we still wanted to look presentable. We realized that this however was more of a minor inconvenience rather than a problem. However, for a more important occasion, like a date or a party, most people, if not all people worry about what they are going to wear, as they want to look put together. We decided to help remove this stress from not only our lives but also other people's lives through styl.

## What it does
Our web application, styl, as of right now, is meant for college students who have an event coming up and, and are not quite sure what to wear. A student will input their occasion, any accessories they might want to wear, their gender, and their age, and from there, styl will generate an image and description of a stylish outfit the student could wear.

## How we built it
We built our application on the Convex framework, which is a development platform based on Typescript.

## Challenges we ran into
A big issue that we ran into was implementing OpenAI's Dall-E and ChatGPT4.0, routing them to their specified feature in the web app, making specific prompts for them, and making them work together. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're thrilled to have figured out how to implement both OpenAI tools into our application.

## What we learned
We learned how to use Convex and make a web application that is based on Typescript rather than Javascript.

## What's next for styl
The first feature would be to train Dall-E to produce more realistic adults, rather than ones with unrealistic standards so that our application can be used for any age demographic. We also plan on adding a feature where once an outfit is displayed, the user can scroll down the page and each clothing article will have its own view, with a few links and photos, so that the user can buy the clothes if they don't already have them in their closet. Additionally, making a user base where the program can learn each user's style, and customize the outfits to each user is a feature that would be great for the application.
